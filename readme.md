## Link to site: 

## Description:
This website will be a fun site that will allow users to take a sorting hat quiz that will assign them to one of the 4 Harry Potter houses. Once the quiz is complete and the answer is revealed they can create a user profile. They will be able to find and favorite spells and potions as well as check out their friends' profiles. 
 
## Usergroup:
I envision the demographic being elementary school kids and up. The quiz will ask simple school age appropriate questions for a little bit of fun.
