# Title: Harry Potter Spells and Potions

## Link to site: 

## Description:
This website will be a fun site that will allow users to take a sorting hat quiz that will assign them to one of the 4 Harry Potter houses. Once the quiz is complete and the answer is revealed they can create a user profile. They will be able to search for spells and potions by typing a letter and letting autocomplete find mathces. They can see potion and spell details and decide to add them to their spellbook or potion sheld. They can check out other wizards' profiles (their friends). They can retake the sorting hat quiz to see if they get a different house and they can also take a fun wizard name quiz which can be added to their user profile.
 
## User Group:
I envision the demographic being elementary school kids and up. The quiz will ask simple school age appropriate questions for a little bit of fun.
