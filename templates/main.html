                    <p>Gryffindor was one of the four Houses of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and was
                        founded by Godric Gryffindor. Gryffindor instructed the Sorting Hat to choose students
                        possessing characteristics he most valued, such as courage, chivalry, nerve and determination,to
                        be sorted into his house.
                    <p>
                    <p>The emblematic animal was a lion, and its colours were scarlet and gold and its house point
                        hourglass was filled with rubies. Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington, also known as 'Nearly
                        Headless Nick', was the House ghost.</p>
                    <p>Gryffindor corresponded roughly to the element of fire, and it was for this reason that the
                        colours scarlet and gold were chosen to represent the house. The colour of fire corresponded to
                        that of a lion as well, with scarlet representing the mane and tail and gold representing the
                        coat.</p>
                    <p>The Gryffindor motto was 'Forti Animo Estote', which was displayed on a stained glass window in
                        the common room.[1]</p>

                    <p>Slytherin was one of the four Houses at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, founded by
                        Salazar Slytherin. In establishing the house, Salazar instructed the Sorting Hat to pick
                        students who had a few particular characteristics he most valued. Those characteristics included
                        cunning, resourcefulness, leadership, and ambition.</p>
                    <p>
                        Many Slytherin students tended to clique together (often acquiring leaders) which further
                        exemplified Slytherin's ambitious qualities. Examples of these included Draco Malfoy's gang,
                        Merula Snyde's gang, Pansy Parkinson's gang and Tom Riddle's gang (which later became the Death
                        Eaters).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The founder highly valued and favoured pure-blood students and the Sorting Hat admitted that it
                        could be a factor when being sorted. Students of any blood status could be placed in the house.
                        However, a Muggle-born student from that house was considered to be quite rare.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The emblematic animal of the house was a snake and the house's colours were green and silver.
                        There were two notable heads of the house; Horace Slughorn took the role twice (first leaving in
                        1981 and then taking the role again from 1997 until leaving before 2016), and Severus Snape.The
                        patron ghost of the house was the Bloody Baron.[1]

                    {% if user.house == 'Hufflepuff' %}
                    <p>Hufflepuff was one of the four Houses of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.Its founder
                        was the medieval witch Helga Hufflepuff. Hufflepuff was the most inclusive among the four
                        houses, valuing hard work, dedication, patience, loyalty, and fair play rather than a particular
                        aptitude in its members.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The emblematic animal was a badger,and yellow and black were its house colours.The Head of
                        Hufflepuff was Pomona Sprout, and the Fat Friar was the House's patron ghost.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Hufflepuff corresponded roughly to the element of earth, and it was for that reason that the
                        House colours were chosen: yellow represented wheat, while black was emblematic of soil. The
                        Hufflepuff point hourglass contained yellow diamonds.Students sorted into Hufflepuff often
                        demonstrated strong abilities in Herbology, owing to their correspondence to earth.[1]

                        was the medieval witch Rowena Ravenclaw. Members of this house were characterised by their wit,
                        learning, and wisdom. The emblematic animal symbol was an eagle, and blue and bronze were its
                        colours. The Head of Ravenclaw was Filius Flitwick, and the House ghost was the Grey Lady,
                        real name Helena Ravenclaw, daughter of Rowena.</p>
                    <p>

                        Ravenclaw corresponded roughly to the element of air, and it was for that reason that the House
                        colours were chosen; blue and bronze represented the sky and eagle feathers respectively, both
                        having much to do with air. The Ravenclaw points hourglass contained blue sapphires.[1]
